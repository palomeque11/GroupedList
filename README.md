Create a mobile application using Kotlin that leverages modern Android development practices and libraries to provide a seamless user experience. This app will utilize Retrofit for API calls, MVVM architecture for clean design, Hilt for dependency injection, and interactive UI elements with expandable sub-lists that can be grouped and sorted. Users will have the ability to display or hide details within each sub-list item with a simple click.

# Key Features:

## API Integration with Retrofit:

Utilize Retrofit to make API calls to fetch and display data from external sources. Ensure smooth data retrieval and handling.
## MVVM Architecture:

Implement a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to separate concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.
## Hilt for Dependency Injection:

Employ Hilt, a dependency injection library, to manage and simplify the injection of dependencies across the app. This will improve code modularity and testability.
## Interactive UI with Expandable Sub-Lists:

Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface with expandable sub-lists. Users can tap on each sub-list item to reveal or hide additional details, enhancing the user experience.
## Grouping and Sorting of Sub-Lists:

Implement functionality to group and sort sub-list items based on relevant criteria. Allow users to easily organize and access information.
## User-Friendly Experience:

Focus on providing a clean and visually appealing user interface to ensure user satisfaction and engagement.
## Efficient Data Handling:

Optimize data handling and storage to ensure the app's performance and responsiveness.
